(1) different players can be assigned different strategies that lead
to different behavior using the Strategy design pattern; 
(2) the strategy adopted by a player can be changed
dynamically during play, 
(3) the human player makes decisions according to user interaction, and computer
players make decisions automatically, which are both implemented using the strategy pattern.
